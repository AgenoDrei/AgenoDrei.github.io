I finished my Master in Computer Science with a focus on Life Science Informatics and Computer Vision in Bonn and am now completing my studies in Human Medicine at [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/master-medicine). 

My goal is to research medical applications in diagnosis, prognosis and treatments for recent advances in image and video analysis. Currently, I support the [Working Group Wintergerst](https://www.ukbonn.de/experimentelle-ophthalmologie/ag-wintergerst/) as a research assistant smartphone-assisted diabetic retinopathy detection and Small Incision Catarat Surgery (SICS) analysis. Previously, I have worked in various projects for IBM Germany, Fraunhofer Institutes and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as a software engineer.
