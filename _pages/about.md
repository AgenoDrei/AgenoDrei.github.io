I finished my Master in Computer Science with a focus on Life Science Informatics and Computer Vision in Bonn and am now completing my studies in Human Medicine at Maastricht University. My goal is to research medical applications in diagnosis, prognosis and treatments for recent advances in image and video analysis.
